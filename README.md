## Project Overview

The Fake News Detection project uses machine learning and NLP techniques to analyze text data and classify news articles as "Real" or "Fake." Key aspects include:
- **Data Collection**: Using a dataset of news articles.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and tokenizing text.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating TF-IDF vectors.
- **Modeling**: Training models with Random Forest, logistic regression, and other algorithms.
- **Fairness Assessment**: Performing fairness audits using demographic parity difference metrics to detect any bias in model predictions.

This project is ideal for gaining insights into both the modelâ€™s performance and the ethical implications of machine learning in sensitive applications.

## Results and Findings

## Model Performance
**Random Forest Model:** Achieved a classification accuracy of 92% in detecting fake news.
**Logistic Regression:** Achieved slightly lower accuracy but provided interpretability advantages.

## Fairness and Bias Audit
Using demographic parity difference and equalized odds, we identified a demographic parity difference of 0.324, indicating some bias in predictions. Future steps include:
**Improving Fairness:** Exploring mitigation strategies, such as reweighting or retraining on balanced data.
Visualizing Fairness: Charts and graphs illustrate the disparity, showing areas for improvement.
